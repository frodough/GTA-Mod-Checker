# GTA-Mod-Checker

The GTA-Mod-Checker program is a highly convenient utility that allows you to easily manage your installed mods for Grand Theft Auto 5. With this program, you can quickly scan your game's install directory and identify all of the mods that you currently have installed.

Once the scan is complete, the program will give you the option to move all of your mods to a folder of your choice, making it easy to switch between playing the game online and using mods. When you're ready to play offline, simply press a button to move your mods back to the game directory.
